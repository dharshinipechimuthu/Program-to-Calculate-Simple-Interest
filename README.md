# Given values
principal = 5000   # Principal amount in Rs.
rate = 5           # Rate of Interest per annum in %
time = 3           # Time in years

# Calculate Simple Interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Display result
print("Principal Amount  :", principal)
print("Rate of Interest  :", rate, "%")
print("Time (Years)      :", time)
print("Simple Interest   :", simple_interest)

Output:
Principal Amount  : 5000
Rate of Interest  : 5 %
Time (Years)      : 3
Simple Interest   : 750.0
